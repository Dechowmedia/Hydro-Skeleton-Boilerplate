#Hydro Skeleton Boilerplate#
##Skeleton CSS & HTML5 Boilerplate goodness in one neat package##

This is a very young but simple project. I have made a merge of two beautiful projects.

[**The HTML5 Boilerplate**](http://html5boilerplate.com) - which brings HTML5 to todays browsers with consistency, browser hacks, jQuery and much more. It is the best base plate out there to get started with perfect HTML5 on every project.

[**Skeleton**](http://getskeleton.com) - a collection of of media queries to make your website flexible and consistent across screen sizes.

So you get two things, consistency across browsers, and consistency across screen sizes.  
  
It's based on the 960 Grid.


**What have I then modified?**  
I have converted Skeleton CSS's widths to percentages and imported Ryan Faith's Sticky Footer. Added some icons made by good friend **Askan**
Im planning on importing major parts from the HTML5 Mobile Boilerplate in order to allow more mobile rich applications.  But this might be far out, as of now I just want people to enjoy.
